Can solve equations of the form A.x = b, provided exactly one solution exists.

it takes the matrix A|b, and outputs a matrix I|s, where I is the identity matrix, and s are the solutions for the n variables

There are no safeguards for:
- malformed matrices
- unsolvable equations
- equations with degrees of freedom
